# 🏃 Marathon Run Analysis with Python & Pandas

This project uses **Python** and the powerful **Pandas** library to perform an in-depth analysis of marathon running data. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights related to runner performance across different demographics such as **age**, **gender**, and **nationality**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**The aim of this analysis is to answer critical performance-related questions, including:**

- ⏱️ Average finish times across various demographics  
- 👥 Performance variation by age and gender  
- 🌍 Impact of external factors such as nationality and weather  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python 3  
- 🧮 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

- ✅ Handled missing values and outliers  
- 🧾 Standardized column formats  
- ⏲️ Parsed and converted time-related fields  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Grouped data by key attributes like **age**, **gender**, and **country**  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- 🕓 Distribution of finishing times  
- 📉 Trends by age groups  
- ⚥ Gender-based performance comparison  
- 🌐 Country-wise performance breakdown  
- 🔗 Correlation analysis between **age**, **pace**, and **results**
