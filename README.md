🏃 Marathon Run Analysis with Python & Pandas
This project uses Python and the powerful Pandas library to perform an in-depth analysis of marathon running data. The objective is to uncover trends, patterns, and potential insights from a marathon dataset — including runner performance by age, gender, nationality, and other influencing factors.

📊 Project Overview
Goal:
To analyze marathon data and answer key questions about runner performance. This includes:

Average finish times across various demographics

Performance variation by age and gender

Impact of external factors such as weather and nationality

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled missing values and outliers

Standardized column formats

Parsed and converted time-related fields

Grouped and categorized data by key attributes (age, gender, country, etc.)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Distribution of finishing times

Performance trends over different age groups

Gender-based comparisons

Country-wise performance averages

Correlation analysis between factors like age, pace, and results

📈 Key Insights
Younger age groups generally perform faster in full marathons

Male and female runners show different pacing strategies

Certain nationalities dominate top finisher rankings

Weather conditions can noticeably influence average finishing times (if applicable)
